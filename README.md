# Quotes To Scrape - Authors Informations

This is a simple web scraping project built with Selenium that scrapes quotes from the "Quotes to Scrape" website. The project retrieves data such as authors' names, birthdates, and birthplaces and stores them in a dictionary. Finally, the dictionary is converted into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as an Excel file.
